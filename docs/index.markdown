## The association

### Who we are
We are a group of people passionate about trading card games and competitive events of such games. We are particularly in love with [Magic: The Gathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering), a card game where players take the role of mages who battle each other for victory. This game has a 30 years long history of competitive play that we aim to keep alive and foster here in Switzerland. To do so, we regularly organise high-stake tournaments in the ZÃ¼rich area and launched a nation-wide competitive league that allows players all over Switzerland to compete against each other at the highest possible level of play.

As tournament organisers, we are dedicated to providing the best possible experience for players at our events. This includes coordinating the logistics of the tournament, such as securing a venue and scheduling matches, as well as enforcing the rules of the game and handling any disputes that may arise.

We also strive to make our tournaments as accessible as possible, by promoting them to the Magic: The Gathering community.
{: .text-justify}

Overall, our goal is to provide a fair and enjoyable environment for Magic: The Gathering players to compete and have fun.

### Magic, The Gathering

Magic: The Gathering is a popular collectible card game that has been enjoyed by players around the world for 30 years. The game can be described as a mix between chess and poker. In this game, a player assembles a deck of 60 cards selected out of a pool of over 20'000 cards, aiming to have the deck be able to execute a strategy leading him to victory.

Once their respective decks are assembled, two players play against each other, trying to execute their strategy to the best of their skill while trying to stop their opponents from executing them. This requires a good understanding of the game, some bluffing skills, and a little bit of luck!

## Past events

We started organising tournaments in late summer 2021, once the social distance measures were lifted. At the time, due to Corona, the competitive Magic scene had suffered quite a lot and we were happy to provide players with an event where they could again meet in person. We received an overwhelming positive feedback and have kept organising tournaments since then.
